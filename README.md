# Astro Blog Tutorial

In this series, I’ll show you how to get started with the web framework Astro by building a custom blog from scratch. We’ll cover everything from building simple UI components to advanced routing, pagination, generating an RSS feed, incorporating React, Tailwind, or a CMS, and more!. In the end, we’ll publish the finished code to Netlify and I'll show you how to update your blog with each new post.
